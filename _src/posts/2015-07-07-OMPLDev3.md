<div class="subtitle">Visualization</div>

Once a motion planning problem has been solved, the user is presented with
several options for visualizing the solution. Initially, a line is displayed
indicating the path from the start position to the goal position. The user can
then toggle an animation of the robot and adjust its speed as it travels from
its starting position to the goal. In addition, a static visualization
consisting of robots placed at points along the solution path is also available.

<img src="../images/omplweb/solution_anim.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<center>A "path robot" (top left) travels from the start position (bottom left) to the goal position (bottom-right).</center>

<img src="../images/omplweb/solution_static.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<center>A static view of the robot's orientation at each point along the
solution path.</center>

The user can interact with the visualiztion using the mouse. Left-clicking and
dragging will rotate the environment while right-clicking and dragging will pan.
The visualization was constructed with [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)
using the [THREE.js](http://threejs.org) library.
