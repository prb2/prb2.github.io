<center>Glen Flora, Texas - Jan. 24, 2015</center>
<br>

I took this photo in the small town of Glen Flora, about an hour southwest of
Houston. Over the course of this past Spring semester, I spent time
photographing the Colorado and Brazos rivers. This photo was taken on my first
trek, when I visited the Colorado River. In the map below, you can see the Colorado just to the
left of the town itself.
