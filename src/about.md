## About me

I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.grail.com">Grail</a>.

Previously, I worked at Amazon Go on the "Just Walk Out" cashier-less grocery
store technology.

Before that, I studied computer science at Rice University and worked as a
research assistant under Professors Lydia Kavraki and Mark Moll in the
Physical and Biological Computing Group.
