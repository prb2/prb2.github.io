## About me

I live in Seattle. Gimme a wave if you see me in the bike lane.

I currently work as a software engineer at <a
href="https://www.luminarycloud.com">Luminary Cloud</a>, a computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) startup.

Previously, I:

- worked on [Reflow](https://github.com/grailbio/reflow) (infrastructure for
next generation sequencing bioinformatics pipelines) at
[GRAIL](https://grail.com)

- worked at Amazon ("Just Walk Out" cashier-less grocery store technology, Alexa
APIs)


I studied computer science at Rice University and worked as a research assistant
under Professors Lydia Kavraki and Mark Moll in the Physical and Biological
Computing Group.
