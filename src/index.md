### About me
I'm a software engineer currently based in Seattle. Here are some things
I've worked on:

- computational fluid dynamics (CFD) APIs at [Luminary Cloud](https://www.luminarycloud.com)

- [Reflow](https://github.com/grailbio/reflow), a
programming language and runtime for distributed, incremental
execution of next generation sequencing (NGS) bioinformatics
pipelines at [GRAIL](https://grail.com)

- the latest generation of vision-only "Just Walk Out" cashier-less grocery
store technology at Amazon

I studied computer science at Rice University and worked as a research assistant
under Professors Lydia Kavraki and Mark Moll in the [Physical and Biological
Computing Group](https://kavrakilab.org).
