# OMPL Web Development - Part 4
**2015-07-07**

With problem configuration and visualization implemented, the next big
feature is benchmarking.

<div class="subtitle">Benchmarking</div>

#### Motivation
Benchmarking is an important feature of OMPL Web that does not exist in its
desktop counterpart. Since each planner has a unique way of finding solutions,
different planners may be better suited for different types of problems. For
this reason, it is important to know when to use a specific
planner. By benchmarking multiple planners on a given problem, we can compare
each planner's performance across various metrics such as time, memory, solution
length, etc.

Furthermore, since the planners are all sampling-based, the problem can be
solved repeatedly to get consistent data.

#### Implementation
The benchmarking functionality of OMPL Web allows a user to
solve any given problem `n` times with multiple planners and various planner
configurations. On the `Benchmarking` page, the user can add and configure the
planners to be benchmarked. Then, they can submit a job to the server
and be notified via email when the job completes.

When the user submits a job, a `.cfg` file is created on the client-side
containing all of the problem configuration details and benchmarking settings.
This information is sent to the server for processing. The server processes this
data using the benchmarking scripts included in OMPL and creates a SQLite
database of results. Currently, this (very small) database is emailed to the
user. This database file can be uploaded to [Planner
Arena](http://plannerarena.org) for an interactive visualization of the
results.

In the future, the benchmarking results will be made available to the user 
directly on [Planner Arena](http://plannerarena.org)
without the need for the user to obtain the database file.
