Significant progress has been made in the past week or so and the application looks
and behaves very differently than before. Furthermore, the user interface has
been completely overhauled to accommodate new features and look cleaner.

## Design & Functionality

The biggest change in terms of the interface is the addition of the visualization
to the configuration page. Now, the robot's position will be updated to reflect
any changes the user makes in the configuration panel. When the problem has
been configured to the user's liking and solved, the solution path (if one was
found) will be drawn and animated.

The visualization is being built primarily using
[WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) with the [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
library.

If the user selects an existing problem from the `Problem` drop down menu, a
request is sent to the server to retrieve that problem's configuration
information and its robot and environment models. The configuration fields are
then filled in with the information from the server and the models are loaded and
drawn. The screenshot above is state of the interface when an existing problem has
been selected.

If the user selects a custom problem from the `Problem` drop
down menu, then the sidebar will expand to reveal options for uploading custom
robot and environment models and, optionally, a configuration file. Once these
files have been selected, the will be uploaded to the server and drawn, as seen
in the screenshot below.

The `Planner` tab allows the user to select which planner to use for solving
the problem. When a planner is selected, the default values for that planner's
parameters are retrieved from the server and displayed. The user can edit these
options if they wish. The `Bounds` tab allows the user to modify the bounding
box for the problem, if they are dissatisfied with the default values for that
environment.

Finally, from `Solve` tab, the user can name the problem and specify a time
limit for solving the problem. If all the required fields are satisfied, they
can click the solve button and await the results. At this point the problem is
sent to the server for processing. When the results are returned, the
information is displayed within the pane. If a successful solution path was
found, it will be drawn and the robot will be animated traveling the path. This
animation is still in development.
