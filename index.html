    I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.grail.com">Grail</a>.

    <br><br>

    Previously, I worked at Amazon Go on the "Just Walk Out" cashier-less grocery
    store technology.

    <br><br>

    Before that, I studied computer science at Rice University and worked as a
    research assistant under Professors Lydia Kavraki and Mark Moll in the
    Physical and Biological Computing Group.
