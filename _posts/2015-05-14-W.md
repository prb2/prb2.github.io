title: W
---

Ever since I started using Vim regularly, I find myself looking for ways to do
more things from the command line. So, today I set out to write a basic command
line program for viewing the weather. W is a python script that displays
weather data for a given location and timeframe. I'm sure there are many like
it, but this one is mine.

</br>

The script is invoked like this: ```$ ./w.py <city> <option>```

Where `<option>` can be:

`today` displays today's weather

`tomorrow` displays tomorrow's weather

`week` displays a five day forecast

`sun` displays sunrise and sunset times

`wind` displays current wind conditions

</br>

Take a look at the [<u>project page</u>](http://prb2.github.io/weather)
for details on installation and usage. [&#10230;](http://prb2.github.io/weather)
