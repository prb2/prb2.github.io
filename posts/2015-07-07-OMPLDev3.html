Visualization
</div>
<p>Once a motion planning problem has been solved, the user is presented
with several options for visualizing the solution. Initially, a line is
displayed indicating the path from the start position to the goal
position. The user can then toggle an animation of the robot and adjust
its speed as it travels from its starting position to the goal. In
addition, a static visualization consisting of robots placed at points
along the solution path is also available.</p>

to the goal position (bottom-right).

<img src="../images/omplweb/solution_static.jpg" class="img-responsive">

solution path.

<p>The user can interact with the visualiztion using the mouse.
Left-clicking and dragging will rotate the environment while
right-clicking and dragging will pan. The visualization was constructed
with <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> using the <a
href="http://threejs.org">THREE.js</a> library.</p>
