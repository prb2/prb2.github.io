<h1 id="ompl-web-development---part-1">OMPL Web Development - Part
1</h1>
<p><strong>2015-06-08</strong></p>
<p>This summer, I am working in the <a
href="http://www.kavrakilab.org">Kavraki Lab</a> research group at Rice
University. My main project this summer will be to create a web
application that will allow users to solve motion planning problems for
robots using the Open Motion Planning Library.</p>
<p>An existing application, called <a
href="http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/gui.html">OMPL.app</a>, is available
for desktop clients but it involves a fairly lengthy installation
process. The purpose of the web application is to provide all of the
features of the desktop application and then some. Users will be able to
configure a motion planning problem and solve for a solution path. Upon
success, the solution will be displayed and the user will be able to
interact with the path. The functionality described thus far already
exists in OMPL.app, but the web application will have several key
improvements.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>One of primary motivations for creating the web version is to
drastically reduce the time it takes to go from being interested in
motion planning to actually creating and solving motion planning
problems. The following steps must be carried out before solving a
motion planning problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OMPL.app</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the OMPL library and its dependencies</li>
<li>Install all dependencises</li>
<li>Build OMPL</li>
<li>Generate Python bindings</li>
<li>Run OMPL.app</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OMPL Web</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the website</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>OMPL.app can take hours to setup; the web implementation will take
mere seconds.</p>

Benchmarking
</div>
<p>The other important improvement will be planner benchmarking. OMPL
takes a sample-based approach to motion planning and there exist many
planners for utilizing different sampling methods. In addition to the
dozen or so planners that are available within OMPL, users can create
their own planners and use those instead. Due to the significant
variation in how planners operate, selecting a particular planner may
yield better results for a specific query than some other planner. For
this reason it is important to have the ability to compare the results
of different planners for a given problem. Currently, planners can be
compared on the <a href="http://plannerarena.org">Planner Arena</a>
website.</p>
<p>Once a user is satisfied with their problem configuration on the OMPL
Web application, they will be able to submit a job to the server for
benchmarking. They can specify benchmarking parameters such as the
number of iterations to run each planner, time limits, etc. When the job
is completed, the user will be notified and their results will be
available on Planner Arena for analysis.</p>
<p>In the next development blog entry, I will discuss the work that Iâ€™ve
completed so far and the high level plan for the remaining
development.</p>
